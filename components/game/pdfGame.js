              #1 What it is: An easy, fast game that everyone probably already
              knows. But I like to be comprehensive, so here we go with some
              rock-paper-scissors instructions. Rock-paper-scissors is a quick
              win-loose game that is often used to determine who will go first
              or who will win some other small privilege.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              #2 Best for: Two players. But you could have a giant
              rock-paper-scissors tournament with tons of people!{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              #3 What you need: Nothing! Well, technically speaking, each player
              needs to use their two hands.
            </p>
            <p>
              #4 How to play: In rock-paper-scissors, two players will each
              randomly choose one of three hand signs: rock (made by making a
              fist), paper (made by laying your hand flat), or scissors (made by
              holding out two fingers to look like scissors). Both players show
              their signs at the same time to see who will win. Here are the
              rules that determine which sign beats another:{" "}
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Rock wins over scissors (because rock smashes scissors) </li>
              <li>Scissors wins over paper (because scissors cut paper) </li>
              <li>Paper wins over rock (because paper covers rock)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </Text>
        <Text
          style={styles.pageNumber}
          render={({ pageNumber, totalPages }) =>
            `${pageNumber} / ${totalPages}`
          }
        />
      </Page>
    </Document>
  );
};
